## TRAINING ####################################################################

# Options of training jobs (job.type=="train")
train:
  # Split used for training (specified under 'dataset.files').
  split: train

  # Type of training job (see respective configuration key). LibKGE ships with
  # the following jobs:
  # - KvsAll: scores each unique sp/po/so pair along with all possible completions.
  # - negative_sampling: scores each unique spo triple along with sampled corrupted
  #   triples
  # - 1vsAll: scores each spo triples against the complete set of s/p-corrputed triples
  #   (all treated negative)
  type: KvsAll

  # Loss used for training (bce, kl, or margin_ranking).
  #
  # KL divergence / cross entropy (kl, all training types): Take softmax over a
  # set of scores, then compute KL divergence between the so-obtained model
  # distribution and data distribution. Computed once for each positive triple
  # and slot (i.e., separately for the subject, relation, and object slots).
  # Equivalent to cross-entropy loss often found in the literature.
  #
  # Margin ranking (margin_ranking, negative_sampling only): Compute margin
  # between score of positive triple and score of one of its negative triples.
  # Computed once per negative triple. See loss_arg for parameters.
  #
  # Binary cross entropy (bce, all training types): Apply logistic function to
  # score of triple, then compute binary cross entropy w.r.t. the respective
  # true label. Computed once for each positive and once for each negative
  # triple in the batch. See loss_arg for parameters.
  #
  # Squared error (se, all training types): Calculate squared error between
  # the score of a triple and its true value (0, 1). Computed once for each
  # positive and once for each negative triple in the batch.
  #
  # Generally, the loss values are averaged over the batch elements (e.g.,
  # positive triple for 1vsAll and negative_sampling, sp- or po-pair for
  # KvsAll). If multiple loss values arise for each batch element (e.g., when
  # BCE is used), these individual losses are summed up.
  #
  # LibKGE also supports some other losses, which we do not recommend to use.
  # See kge/loss.py for details.

    # fast_if_available: use fast implementation if available, else standard
    implementation: fast_if_available

  # Whether to share the s/p/o corruptions for all triples in the batch. This
  # can make training more efficient. Cannot be used with together with
  # filtering, but it is ensured that each triple does not get itself as a
  # negative.
  shared: False

  # - naive: Each positive triples uses exactly the same set of shared samples,
  #          even if it's own positive entity is in the shared sample as a
  #          negative. Very fast.
  # - default: Avoid that a positive triple's entity occurs in its shared
  #            negative samples. This is done by using a shared sample size that
  #            is one sample larger then needed. The actual sample of a triple
  #            is then obtained by dropping the sample corresponding to its
  #            positive entity (or a random one if there is no such sample).
  shared_type: 'default'

  # Whether sampling should be performed with replacement. Without replacement
  # sampling is currently only supported for shared sampling.
  with_replacement: True

  # Implementation to use for the negative sampling job. Possible values are:
  # - triple: Scores every positive and negative triple in the batch separately.
  # - all   : Scores against all possible targets and filters relevant scores
  #           out of the resulting score matrix
  # - batch : Scores against all targets contained in batch (or chunk) and
  #           filters relevant scores out of the resulting score matrix.
  # - auto  : Chooses best implementation heuristically. The heuristic may
  #           change in the future.
  #
  # 'batch' is recommended (faster) for models which have efficient
  # implementations to score many targets at once. For all other models, use
  # 'triple' (e.g., for TransE or RotatE in the current implementation). 'auto'
  # tries to do just this heuristically.

  # Maximal budget in terms of full train runs given for the complete search. This
  # control is used to limit the total resource consumption of GraSH. A search budget
  # of 1 roughly equals the resource consumption of training a model with the
  # user-defined train.max_epochs on the whole graph dataset. We suggest to set the
  # search budget to the number of GraSH rounds you want to have.

  # This per-trial budget is a relative value w.r.t the cost of using the whole graph.

  # - triples_and_entities:  use relative amount of training triples * relative amount
  # of entities in subgraph as cost metric

  # Only relevant for the 'dataset' and 'combined' variant.
  # We cannot use the original validation set because it likely contains entities that
  # are not present in subgraphs. To enable an evaluation of subgraph models, we
  # generate a new validation set for each subgraph. Its size is generally specified as
  # a relative fraction (valid_frac) of all triples contained in the subgraph. In
  # addition, we use an absolute upperbound (valid_max) to limit the size.
  # I.e., valid_set_size = min(valid_frac*num_triples, valid_max)
