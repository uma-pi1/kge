## TRAINING ####################################################################

# Options of training jobs (job.type=="train")
train:
  # Split used for training (specified under 'dataset.files').
  split: train

  # Type of training job.
  # - KvsAll: scores each unique sp/po/so pair along with all possible completions.
  # - negative_sampling: scores each unique spo triple along with sampled corrupted
  #   triples
  # - 1vsAll: scores each spo triples against the complete set of s/p-corrputed triples
  #   (all treated negative)
  type: KvsAll

  # Loss used for training (bce, kl, or margin_ranking).
  #
  # KL divergence / cross entropy (kl, all training types): Take softmax over a
  # set of scores, then compute KL divergence between the so-obtained model
  # distribution and data distribution. Computed once for each positive triple
  # and slot (i.e., separately for the subject, relation, and object slots).
  # Equivalent to cross-entropy loss often found in the literature.
  #
  # Margin ranking (margin_ranking, negative_sampling only): Compute margin
  # between score of positive triple and score of one of its negative triples.
  # Computed once per negative triple. See loss_arg for parameters.
  #
  # Binary cross entropy (bce, all training types): Apply logistic function to
  # score of triple, then compute binary cross entropy w.r.t. the respective
  # true label. Computed once for each positive and once for each negative
  # triple in the batch. See loss_arg for parameters.
  #
  # Squared error (se, all training types): Calculate squared error between
  # the score of a triple and its true value (0, 1). Computed once for each
  # positive and once for each negative triple in the batch.
  #
  # Generally, the loss values are averaged over the batch elements (e.g.,
  # positive triple for 1vsAll and negative_sampling, sp- or po-pair for
  # KvsAll). If multiple loss values arise for each batch element (e.g., when
  # BCE is used), these individual losses are summed up.
  #
  # LibKGE also supports some other losses, which we do not recommend to use.
  # See kge/loss.py for details.

  #
  # Technically, reduces all labels by fraction given by this value and

  # - batch : Scores against all targets contained in batch (or chunk) and
  #           filters relevant scores out of the resulting score matrix.
  # - auto  : Chooses best implementation based on num_samples.
  #           'batch' if shared sampling is activated or max(num_samples.s,
  #           num_samples.p, num_samples.o) > 30. 'triple' otherwise.
  #
  # 'batch' or 'auto' is recommended (faster) for models which have efficient
  # implementations to score many targets at once. For all other models, use
  # 'triple' (e.g., for TransE or RotatE in the current implementation).
  implementation: triple

  # Perform training in chunks of the specified size. When set, process each
